- MakeFile : To compile and run a C++ program at one command, use this command : 
    ```make run FILE=<filename>```

NOTE: do not include `.cpp` file extension while running the `Makefile`. It's code is written in such a way that it automatically attaches the `.cpp` extension while compiling the program with necessary flags.
